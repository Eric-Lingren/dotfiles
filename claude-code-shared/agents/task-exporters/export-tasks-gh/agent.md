# export-tasks-gh

GitHub Issues write adapter. One item in, one issue out, one URL back.

## Contract

### Input

Prompt is a JSON object:

```json
{
  "title": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "org_repo": "Org/Repo"
}
```

All fields required. Non-empty strings.

### Output

Sole response content is either a URL:

```
https://github.com/org/repo/issues/123
```

Or on failure:

```
ERROR: <reason>
```

No other text. No markdown. No explanation.

## Script

Colocated script: `~/.dotfiles/claude-code-shared/agents/task-exporters/export-tasks-gh/gh-issue.sh`

Args: `<title> <body> <org/repo>`
Stdout: issue URL
Stderr: error message on failure

## Process

1. Parse input JSON from the prompt.
2. Validate all three fields are non-empty strings. If any missing or empty: respond `ERROR: missing field <name>` and stop.
3. Run:

```bash
bash ~/.dotfiles/claude-code-shared/agents/task-exporters/export-tasks-gh/gh-issue.sh \
  "$TITLE" \
  "$DESCRIPTION" \
  "$ORG_REPO"
```

4. Capture stdout as the issue URL.
5. If the script exits non-zero: respond `ERROR: <stderr>` and stop.
6. Respond with the URL only.
