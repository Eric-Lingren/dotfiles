## Delegate menial lookups to Haiku (cost control)

During this skill, push pure read-only lookups DOWN to a cheap subagent instead
of running them on the current model. This covers: multi-file grep/glob,
"where is X defined / what calls Y", mapping a directory, reading many files to
locate something, or fetching a URL for reference.

Use the Agent tool with the `caveman:cavecrew-investigator` subagent (Haiku,
returns a compressed file:line answer). If that subagent is unavailable, spawn a
general agent with `model: haiku`. Keep all reasoning, decisions, and edits on
the current model. Delegate only the menial searching.

# CI Fix

A one-shot skill that diagnoses CircleCI failures on the current branch, applies
all code fixes, and pushes. Semantic fixes are flagged in an inline summary for
post-hoc review. Run once per pipeline failure; re-invoke if a second wave of
failures appears after the push.

---

## Step 0: Auth gate

Before doing anything else, verify CircleCI MCP is available and authenticated.

Call `mcp__circleci__list_skills` (or the equivalent `list_skills` tool in the
CircleCI MCP server). If the call fails, returns an auth error, or the tool is
unavailable:

**Hard refuse. Print:**

```
ci-fix requires the CircleCI MCP server to be authenticated.

To fix:
  1. Open /mcp in a new Claude Code session.
  2. Select the CircleCI MCP server.
  3. Complete the OAuth flow.
  4. Return here and re-run /ci-fix.

Stopping — no changes made.
```

Do not proceed past this step until CircleCI MCP responds successfully.

---

## Step 1: Load the debug-failing-run playbook

Immediately after confirming auth, fetch the CircleCI MCP's own diagnostic
playbook so you follow its prescribed ordering throughout the run.

```
list_skills  →  find the skill named "debug-failing-run" (or closest match)
get_skill(name="debug-failing-run")  →  read and internalize its steps
```

Keep this playbook active throughout Steps 3–4. If CircleCI MCP has no such
skill, continue without it — the steps below are the fallback ordering.

---

## Step 2: Detect branch and resolve project slug

**Detect current branch:**

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

**Resolve CI project slug** — check sources in this order:

1. Read `~/.dotfiles/claude-code-shared/resources/repo-policy.json`. Find the
   entry matching the current repo (match by remote URL via
   `git remote get-url origin`). If that entry has a `ci` field, use
   `ci.project_slug`.

2. If no `ci` field exists: read `.circleci/config.yml` in the project root.
   Extract the project slug from any `circleci.com` URLs or explicit slug
   references in that file.

3. If neither source yields a slug: **stop and report**:
   ```
   Could not resolve a CircleCI project slug for this repo.
   Add a ci field to repo-policy.json or confirm .circleci/config.yml exists.
   Stopping — no changes made.
   ```

The `ci` field shape in repo-policy.json is:
```json
"ci": { "provider": "circleci", "project_slug": "gh/org/repo" }
```

---

## Step 3: Query CircleCI for failing jobs

Use the resolved `project_slug` and `branch` to walk the pipeline.

**Query chain** (follow the debug-failing-run playbook ordering where available):

```
list_runs(project_slug, branch) → pick the latest run
  ↓
list_run_workflows(run_id)       → identify all workflows
  ↓
list_workflow_jobs(workflow_id)  → for each workflow, find FAILED jobs
  ↓
for each failing job:
  get_job(job_number)            → metadata (step breakdown, timing)
  get_job_logs(job_number)       → full log output
  list_job_tests(job_number)     → test results if available (pytest, vitest)
```

Collect all failing jobs before moving to Step 4. Do not fix one job at a time
in isolation — gather the complete failure picture first, then diagnose together
to avoid conflicting fixes.

**If no runs are found** for the current branch: stop and report that no
CircleCI run was found for branch `<branch>`. The user may need to push first.

**If all jobs pass**: print "All jobs passing on <branch> — nothing to fix."
and stop cleanly.

---

## Step 4: Diagnose each failure

For each failing job, classify the failure type from the logs:

| Failure type | Signals |
|---|---|
| **lint** | ruff, biome, flake8 violation output |
| **type error** | pyright, mypy, TypeScript tsc error |
| **test failure** | pytest FAILED / ERRORS, vitest test name + assertion |
| **migration check** | django check --deploy, migration consistency errors |
| **build/config error** | pip-compile hash mismatch, nextjs build error, missing env |
| **dependency error** | pip install failure, npm ci failure |
| **other** | anything that doesn't fit the above |

Build a diagnosis summary before touching any code:

```
Job: <job_name>
Type: <failure_type>
Root cause: <one sentence>
Fix approach: <what to change>
Mechanical? <yes/no — mechanical means the fix is deterministic: e.g. auto-fix lint, regenerate lockfile>
```

A fix is **semantic** if it changes test logic, business logic, build
configuration decisions, or migration files. A fix is **mechanical** if it is
deterministic and reviewable without context (auto-fixable lint, type annotation
insertion, lockfile regeneration).

---

## Step 5: Apply fixes

Fix all failing jobs in a single pass. Do not commit or push until all fixes are
applied and verified.

**Fix approaches by type:**

- **lint**: Apply the auto-fix command for the linter if available (ruff check
  --fix, biome check --apply), then manually fix any remaining violations.
- **type error**: Add or correct type annotations, fix import paths, adjust
  signatures.
- **test failure**: Fix the code under test OR (if test expectations are wrong)
  fix the test. Prefer fixing production code first; fixing tests is semantic.
- **migration check**: Fix model definitions or generate the missing migration.
  Migration generation is semantic — flag it.
- **build/config error**: Fix the config, regenerate lockfiles (pip-compile),
  update env variable references.
- **dependency error**: Update the requirements or package files.
- **other**: Apply judgment; flag as semantic.

**Multi-job conflicts:** If two jobs suggest contradictory fixes, resolve the
conflict before applying. Note the resolution in the final summary.

---

## Step 6: Local verification

Run local verification only for CI steps that existing hooks do not cover.

**Existing hooks already cover (DO NOT re-run these):**
- Lint (ruff, biome, flake8) — covered by `lint-edited-file.sh` (edit-time)
  and `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (commit-time)
- Format (black, biome format) — same hooks

**Run these locally before pushing:**

| Failure type fixed | Verification command |
|---|---|
| Python test failure | `python -m pytest <affected test file(s)> -x` |
| Type error (Python) | `python -m pyright <affected file(s)>` |
| Type error (TS) | `npx tsc --noEmit` in the frontend workspace |
| Frontend test failure | `npx vitest run <affected test file(s)>` |
| Migration check | `python manage.py migrate --check` and `python manage.py check --deploy` |
| Migration rollback | `python manage.py migrate <app> <prev_migration>` then forward again |
| Nextjs build error | `npx next build` (only if the failure was in the build step) |

Run only the verification commands relevant to the failure types you fixed. If
verification fails: **stop. Do not push.** Print:

```
Local verification failed for <step>.
Output:
  <command output>

Fix the above before pushing. Re-run /ci-fix after resolving.
```

If all relevant verifications pass (or there are no non-hook-covered steps),
continue to Step 7.

---

## Step 7: Push

Push via gxpush with the `--auto` flag, which handles staging, secret scanning,
commit message generation, and push:

```bash
~/.dotfiles/.scripts/gxpush --auto
```

Do not stage files manually or construct a commit message — gxpush --auto owns
that.

If gxpush exits non-zero: stop and surface the full output to the user. Do not
retry automatically.

---

## Step 8: Inline summary

After a successful push, print a structured summary.

**Format:**

```
CI Fix — <branch> — <N> job(s) fixed

Mechanical fixes (M):
  - <job_name>: <one-line description> [e.g. "ruff: 3 unused imports removed"]
  - <job_name>: <one-line description>

Semantic fixes (S) — review recommended:
  - <job_name>: <one-line description>
    Diff:
      <minimal diff snippet showing what changed>
    Reasoning: <why this fix was applied>
```

If there are no semantic fixes, omit that section. If all fixes are semantic,
omit the mechanical section.
