## Architecture block

The `architecture` key is optional on older runs. Present on all runs after Step 6 was added.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `architecture_score` | float 0–100 | `confirmed_passed / 7 * 100` |
| `signals` | object | Per-signal A1–A7 pass (true) / fail (false) |
| `recommendations` | array | Confirmed findings with lifecycle labels |

### Recommendation record

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `signal` | string | A1–A7 |
| `finding` | string | One sentence |
| `location` | string | `path:line` |
| `recommendation` | string | One sentence |
| `proposed_agent` | string\|null | null for non-extraction findings |
| `consumers` | array\|null | Skills that would consume proposed agent |
| `benefit` | string | Value of the change |
| `effort` | string | low\|medium\|high |
| `lifecycle` | string | NEW \| PERSISTING \| RESOLVED |
