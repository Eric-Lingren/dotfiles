# Tasks to Linear

Convert a `docs/tasks/` JSON file into Linear tickets. Creates one issue per task, links blocked-by relationships using real Linear issue IDs, and writes the created issue URLs back into the JSON file.

## Contract

**Format:** task file — see `contracts/task-contract.md` (schema_version: `"1"`)
**Role:** consumer (reads tasks, writes back `linear_url` per task)

**Step-0 — validate input before processing:**
```bash
bash ~/.dotfiles/claude-code-shared/scripts/validate-schema.sh \
  --instance ~/.dotfiles/claude-code-shared/contracts/task-schema.json \
  <input-path>
```
On non-zero exit: STOP. Report stderr to the user. Do not process the file.

After writing `linear_url` back to each task, the file remains valid per task-schema.json (`linear_url` is a declared optional field).

## Process

### 1. Locate the task file

List all JSON files in `docs/tasks/`. If the user provided a filename or slug as an argument, match it. Otherwise show the list and ask the user to choose. Require explicit selection — never auto-pick.

If `docs/tasks/` doesn't exist or is empty, tell the user to run `/to-tasks` first.

### 2. Parse the task file and load context

Read the selected JSON file. Extract:
- **slug** — derive from the task filename itself by stripping the leading timestamp prefix (`YYYYMMDD-HHMM-`) and `.json` extension. This slug is the title prefix for every Linear ticket in this batch. Example: `20260602-1234-jwt-auth-migration.json` → `jwt-auth-migration`.
- `source` field — the upstream artifact, if any.
- `tasks` array — the issues to create.

**Load upstream context (when available):** If `source.ref` is non-null (source.type is `"seed"` or `"prd"`), read the artifact at `source.ref` and extract:
- **Problem Statement** — why this work exists
- **Solution** — the high-level approach
- **Implementation Decisions** — all phases, rules, and technical decisions
- **Out of Scope** — what is explicitly not being built

Embed this context in every ticket description so that agents working the ticket have full context without needing to access the source file separately.

**When `source.ref` is null** (source.type is `"session"`, or source is null): skip the upstream context load. The ticket descriptions will be built from each task's own `description` and `acceptance_criteria` fields, which must already be self-contained.

### 3. Ask for the Linear team

Call `list_teams` and show the results. Ask the user which team to create the issues in. Require an explicit selection.

### 4. Ask for a project (optional)

Call `list_projects` filtered to the chosen team and show the results. Ask if the user wants to attach all issues to a project. Wait for the user's answer before proceeding. This is optional — if they say no or there are no relevant projects, skip it.

### 5. Ask for a status (optional)

Call `list_issue_statuses` for the chosen team and show the results. Ask the user which status to assign to all created issues. Wait for the user's answer before proceeding. This is optional — if they say no or want the Linear default, skip it.

### 6. Ask for labels (optional)

Call `list_issue_labels` for the chosen team and show the results. Ask the user which labels (if any) to apply to all created issues. Wait for the user's answer before proceeding. This is optional — if they say no, skip it.

### 7. Check for already-created issues

Scan the `tasks` array for any entries where `linear_url` is already set. If any exist, tell the user and ask whether to:
- **Skip** already-created issues and only create the missing ones
- **Recreate all** — create fresh issues for everything (does not delete old ones)

### 8. Create issues in dependency waves

Compute dependency waves (same logic as build-code): Wave 1 = tasks with no `blocked_by`. Wave 2 = tasks whose blockers are all in Wave 1. And so on.

Within each wave, all tasks are independent. Spawn all agents in a wave in a single parallel batch (one Agent call per task, all in the same message). Collect the full wave's results before starting the next wave. Build the `task-id → linear-issue-id` mapping from each wave's results before spawning the next wave, so `blocked_by_linear_ids` can reference real IDs.

For each task, assemble the full ticket title and description, then spawn the `export-tasks-linear` agent to create the Linear issue.

**Title:** `{slug}: {task title}` (where `slug` is derived from the task filename as described in step 2)
Example: `jwt-auth-migration: Bootstrap JWT signing infrastructure`

**Description** (Markdown):

The description must be fully self-contained — the agent picking up this ticket will not have access to the PRD or any other file. Structure it as follows:

```
(Ticket authored by Claude Code. Scope vetted and approved by <eng-enter-name-manually>)

## Context

{Problem Statement from the PRD — why this work exists}

## Solution Overview

{Solution section from the PRD — the high-level approach and target end state}

## Relevant Implementation Details

{The specific phases, rules, classification guides, folder structures, naming conventions, and technical decisions from the PRD's Implementation Decisions section that are directly relevant to THIS task. Omit sections that are irrelevant to the task at hand. Include enough detail that the agent can make correct decisions without looking anything up.}

## Out of Scope

{Out of Scope section from the PRD, so the agent knows what not to do}

## This Task

{task description}

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] {criterion 1}
- [ ] {criterion 2}
…
```

**Resolve blockedBy IDs:** for each `blocked_by` task ID in the task, look up the corresponding Linear issue ID from the mapping built during this run (or from existing `linear_url` entries from prior runs).

**Spawn `export-tasks-linear` per task:**

```
Agent(
  subagent_type="export-tasks-linear",
  prompt=JSON.stringify({
    "title": "{slug}: {task.title}",
    "description": "<assembled description above>",
    "team_id": "<selected team id>",
    "project_id": "<selected project id or null>",
    "status_id": "<selected status id or null>",
    "label_ids": ["<selected label ids or empty array>"],
    "blocked_by_linear_ids": ["<resolved linear IDs for blocked_by or empty array>"]
  })
)
```

The agent responds with the Linear issue URL as its sole content, or `ERROR: <reason>` on failure.

Extract the issue URL from the agent response. If the response starts with `ERROR:`, treat the write as failed and note the error.

Build the `task-id → linear-issue-id` mapping from each returned URL (parse the issue identifier, e.g. `ENG-123`, from the URL path) so that subsequent tasks in the same run can reference it in `blocked_by_linear_ids`.

**Fields to never set:** `estimate` or any complexity/story-point field — do not set these under any circumstances.

### 9. Write Linear URLs back to the JSON file

After all issues are created, update the task JSON file: for each task, set a `linear_url` field to the created issue's URL. Write the updated JSON back to the same file path.

### 10. Report results

Print a summary table:

```
Task ID  │ Linear Issue │ Title
─────────┼──────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────
T-0001   │ ENG-123      │ shadcn-component-architecture: Directory consolidation
T-0002   │ ENG-124      │ shadcn-component-architecture: Update Storybook story titles
…
```

Tell the user the JSON file has been updated with `linear_url` fields.
