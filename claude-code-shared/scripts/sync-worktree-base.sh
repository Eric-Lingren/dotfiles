# sync-worktree-base.sh — point a fresh agent worktree at the shared branch tip.
#
# Usage: sync-worktree-base.sh <base-sha> [worktree-path]
#
# build-code spawns build-runner with isolation="worktree". The harness may
# create that worktree from a different commit than the feature branch
# (e.g. main). Without a sync, the runner is missing the feature work and
# improvises cherry-picks, which auto mode blocks.
#
# Safety: only moves HEAD when the worktree is a linked worktree, has a clean
# tree, and holds no commits of its own (nothing outside <base> and main).
# Uses `git reset --keep`, which refuses to drop local changes.
#
# Exit codes: 0 synced or already at base, 1 usage/env error, 3 refused.
