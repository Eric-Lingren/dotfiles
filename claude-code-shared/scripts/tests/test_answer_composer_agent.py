"""Tests for T-0082: answer-composer egress agent.

The answer-composer (Sonnet tier) lives under agents/egress/ and consumes an
investigation-result to compose a voice-matched Slack reply. Rules:
  - VERIFIED_TRUE claims → inline citation with the evidence ref
  - INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE claims → explicit 'couldn't confirm' tag (never smoothed over)
  - No content added beyond what the investigation-result provides
  - Output is copy-only (manual paste to Slack)
  - Voice profile: slack-casual (registered in voice-routing.json)
  - Invariant: agents/egress/ is NOT agents/investigators/ — nothing here emits
    investigation-result; it consumes it.
